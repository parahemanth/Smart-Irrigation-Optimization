//ABSTRACT
Proper water management is of great importance in any agriculture, mostly because of the horticultural crops, which include paddy, corn, chili, and cotton. Uncertain weather conditions and unstable irrigation procedures cause either excessive water usage or a lack of irrigation that has a detrimental effect on yields. The conventional techniques of irrigation lack the measure and accuracy that are required to utilize water in an optimal manner, and hence there is wastage and low yields. This project proposes an IoT-based smart irrigation technology that utilizes climate prediction information gathered from the web to provide appropriate schedules for watering. The system involves using NodeMCU ESP8266 modules and soil moisture sensors and applying machine learning to the captured data to monitor soil moisture and forecast rainfall. From it, real-time soil moisture data together with rainfall can be incorporated to offer the appropriate watering durations with the aim of using water sparingly for paddy, corn, chili, and cotton. If the user agrees, then the system turns on the motor for optimal and right amount of time . This smart irrigation system technology implemented through the IoT greatly enhances the management of the water resource and the yields of these crops by automatically adjusting the time and duration of irrigation depending on the real environmental conditions and eradicating wastage of water in the process, leading to sustainable farming.

Watering is one of the essential aspects of sustainable farming and agriculture which has a direct impact on the quality and quantity of the produce. This is especially so with crops that need water such as paddy, corn, chili, cotton and the like. With climate change and water shortage problems being more and more severe at the global level, there is a need to develop efficient irrigation techniques. Traditional methods of irrigation lead to either over-irrigation or under-irrigation, which are damaging to crop yields and also wastage of water. Therefore, proper use of water in agriculture has never been as important as it is now.


The problem of resource management in todayâ€™s interconnected world has been a major issue due to the rapid growth of IoT devices and predictive analytics. Smart irrigation systems, which currently employ IoT devices and soil moisture sensors, have given a positive indication for automating and enhancing the irrigation process. For example, Ullah et al. (2021) explained that IoT-based irrigation systems could save 50% water and increase crop production by 30% by using soil moisture data for setting irrigation time [2]. In the same vein, Ragab et al. (2022) noted that the adoption of IoT technology in irrigation management could improve the accuracy of water application and the overall performance of crops and other resources [1]. Nevertheless, these systems are typically designed to operate in the present while excluding the forecasted weather conditions. Due to this limitation, there is likely to be overwatering, especially when a rainy season is around the corner. On the other hand, there may be instances when watering is missed due to a dry season. Thus, it is required to implement more complex systems that incorporate both the actual data and the forecasts of weather conditions.

This work fills these gaps by presenting an IoT-based smart irrigation system that incorporates real-time soil moisture status and future weather conditions collected through web scraping. The system incorporates NodeMCU ESP8266 modules, soil moisture sensors, and machine learning algorithms to forecast rainfall and schedule the watering process. Our approach of using the predictive data is meant to offer a comprehensive solution to the problem of water management, thus allowing crops to get the right amount of water at the right time. This system not only reacts to the current soil conditions but also has the capability to predict the future weather changes, which makes it very effective in water management and crop yields. This project postulates that such an integration can lead to sustainable agriculture, effective water use and increase in production of water demanding crops.

1. User Interface:Used to take basic details such as crop type, location of the field and neutral watering time, the user interface is the main interface through which farmers interact with the system. Also, it gives feedback on the recommended watering schedules, enabling farmers to approve them according to their preferences or needs.

2. Server:As the systemâ€™s control centre, the server acquires information from the user interface and other sources including weather information and actual soil moisture data.

4. ThingSpeak Cloud Platform: ThingSpeak is a platform that can be used to relay real-time sensor data as well as information from the soil moisture sensor in particular to the server with the help of the IoT device.

//schematic re
The proposed intelligent irrigation system will include the following components in an effort to improve the current water usage in the irrigation sector. The core of this system is the NodeMCU ESP8266, which serves as the mediator between the hardware components (Water Pump, Soil Moisture Sensor, and Relay Module) and the user interface. This microcontroller that has four PWM channels and which has been programmed with the Arduino is very useful in controlling and monitoring the irrigation system. It also includes a resistive soil moisture sensor for the detection of the moisture content in the soil and this information is sent to the interface backend using the WiFi module through HTTP requests.

The server uses the complex algorithms to analyze the soil moisture data and provide the best time to water the plants. These calculated watering times are then transmitted back to the NodeMCU ESP8266, which controls the relay module to water the plants. The relay module acts as a switch, controlling the water pump and its operation through ON and OFF signals. The water pump that is connected to the relay module provides water to the field effectively as required. This control and synchronization between the component enable the irrigation system to work in the right manner and give the right amount of water based on the current soil moisture. With the help of this system, the conventional methods of irrigation are enhanced and hence the sustainable agriculture is achieved by using the water resource efficiently.

//user
The Intelligent Irrigation System's user interface (UI) is made to be both user-friendly and efficient, meeting farmers' needs and guaranteeing accurate water management. It has two consecutive pages that are designed to encourage user engagement. Farmers include important information on the first page, such as the type of crop, the location of the field, and the usual watering time. This knowledge is essential because it helps to customize irrigation decisions in the future by taking into account the local environment and the water requirements of certain crops. After submission, the data is processed by the system to provide an irrigation strategy that is specific to each user.

The second page contains specific information and actionable options. It dynamically forecasts rainfall and displays real-time soil moisture levels for the specified field location. Simultaneously, it advises a suitable watering schedule according on the crop typeâ€”daily for paddy, every three days for chilli, and weekly for maize and cottonâ€”to maximize resource utilization. Furthermore, the interface visualizes the exact placement of the IoT device and determines the optimal watering period in minutes based on detailed data analytics. This ensures exact water supply based on crop requirements. Farmers retain control by manually adjusting the planned irrigation length before confirming their decision. Following activation, the IoT gadget activates the water pump, allowing the irrigation schedule to be properly implemented.

system implementation

//had setup

The NodeMCU ESP8266 acts as the central processing unit, allowing communication between various physical components and applications. It is set up to work flawlessly with the soil moisture sensor and the relay module, which regulates the water pump. The NodeMCU's 3.3V pin is linked to the VCC pin of the soil moisture sensor, and the GND pin is connected to the soil moisture sensor's GND pin,so it forms a single voltage point of reference. In addition, the relay module's VCC terminal is connected to the NodeMCU's 5V pin, while another GND pin is connected to the relay module's ground (GND).

The NodeMCU's digital pins D1 and D2 are connected to the relay module's signal pin (IN) and the soil moisture sensor's signal pin (S) for data transfer. The relay's common (COM) and normally open (NO) terminals are connected to the water pump's power supply. The NodeMCU may start irrigation by sending a high signal to the relay module, which activates the relay and allows electricity to flow to the water pump. When the watering is finished, the NodeMCU sends a signal to disable the relay and turn off the pump. With this design, real-time data on soil moisture allows for exact control of the irrigation operation.

// dataflow
In the figure we describe data flow diagram of the smart irrigation system, the data that is collected is directly related to the watering needs of the crops in the irrigation system.Farmers are able to input important information such as crop type, field location, and neutral watering time through the user interface, and this information is then forwarded to the server for processing. In this case, the server manages the process of requesting the weather forecast and soil moisture information from other sources and adapts the request process according to the irrigation schedule of the chosen crop.For instance, if the crop is chili and it requires watering after every three days, the system will get information on the next three days. On the other hand, for crops like paddy which are irrigated on daily basis, data is collected on daily basis while for crops like corn and cotton that are irrigated once in week data is collected for the week ahead. This way, the system receives the right and timely information that is appropriate for each crop regarding the water requirements for irrigation scheduling and resource management. After data collection, the server uses machine learning to predict rainfall and calculate the most efficient irrigation intervals and then sends them to the farmer for approval or modification. Upon confirmation, the server interacts with the IoT device to monitor and manage the control of the irrigation system to ensure that crops are watered at specific intervals as per the needs of the crops. In this process, the system maintains a constant check on the soil moisture content and updates the information when changes occur and incorporates the farmerâ€™s feedback to improve the future forecast and improve on the irrigation management. Thus, the intelligent irrigation system achieves the optimal crop production with minimal water usage through this integrated approach.

//linear regression
We scrape weather forecasting data from weather.com using the BeautifulSoup package. The retrieved data is subsequently filtered to produce rainfall projections, which we use as input for our predictive algorithm. Using Python's scikit-learn module, we use linear regression to estimate rainfall patterns by creating a mathematical link between time (x) and expected rainfall (y). The methodology consists of multiple steps: collecting and preparing hourly meteorological data, initializing the Linear Regression class, training the model with historical time and rainfall data, and forecasting future rainfall values. This approach tailors the prediction intervals to the crop type: daily for rice, every three days for chilli, and weekly for corn and cotton. The model's predicted accuracy is measured using measures such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE).


# Importing required libraries
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
import numpy as np


# Instantiate Linear Regression model
rainfall_model = LinearRegression()

# Train the model with historical time and rainfall data
rainfall_model.fit(time_hours, rainfall_mm)

Here x varies based on crop kind

# Predict future rainfall values for the Time Frame (Depends on Crop)
next_x_hours = np.array(range(1, x)).reshape(-1, 1)
predicted_rainfall = rainfall_model.predict(next_x_hours)

Linear regression's simplicity and interpretability make it essential for understanding rainfall patterns, notably in agriculture. Accurate weather predictions have a huge impact on agricultural management and emergency preparedness. Our technique improves weather forecasting capabilities by including linear regression, providing vital insights into the dynamics of temporal rainfall. By incorporating machine learning into our intelligent irrigation system, we can ensure precise irrigation scheduling, promote water saving, and optimize crop health. Predicting rainfall accurately based on past data, customized to the individual demands of different crops, demonstrates the value of data-driven decision-making in modern agriculture.

//interface implementation

The interface is built with Django, a powerful open-source web framework known for its ability to allow rapid development and straightforward design concepts. It includes a REST API to enable smooth integration with internet services that follow REST design principles. The linear regression technique studies weather and soil moisture data to identify relationships and predict average rainfall. This enables for the customisation of irrigation schedules for various crops. ThingSpeak processes NodeMCU data using MATLAB analytics, and the results are shown on a configurable dashboard. NodeMCU gets automatic signals from ThingSpeak, allowing for effective, data-driven smart irrigation control.

//calculation

A crop's specific irrigation schedule and water requirements determine the optimal watering period, which differs greatly depending on the type of crop. For example, paddy fields require daily watering at a rate of 7 mm per day, whereas chilli plants demand 9 mm of water every three days. In contrast, corn and cotton crops require 12.6 and 16 mm of water each week, respectively. Soil moisture levels are crucial in selecting the optimal watering plan. Initially, the system translates soil moisture measurements into millimeters using a predetermined soil constant. Assuming a baseline irrigation period in the absence of soil moisture, the following step combines the computed soil water content with expected rainfall.It then subtracts that amount from the total amount of rainfall and soil water to determine the amount of water deficit left for the crop. After that, the needed irrigation time is calculated using this balance of water. This calculation calculates the time needed to apply 1 mm of water by dividing the neutral watering period by the total amount of water needed per unit time. To determine the ideal watering period in minutes, the system multiplies this time by the balance of water at the end. In order to provide precise and effective irrigation management catered to the unique requirements of every crop, this calculation procedure is smoothly incorporated into the system's user interface.

# Calculation of Soil Water Content
soil_water = soil_moisture_value * 5 * soil_constant * 0.1
# Total Water Required
total_water_required = water_for_crop 
#The water for crop varies from crop to crop 
water_for_crop
paddy - 7mm / Day
chilli- 9mm / 3 Days
corn - 12.6mm / Week
cotton - 16mm / Week
# Balance Water Calculation
balance_water = total_water_required - (soil_water + rainfall)
# Time Calculation for Balance Water
time_for_1mm = water_duration / water_for_crop # Hours required for 1mm of water
total_time_hours = time_for_1mm * balance_water # Total time required in hours
total_time_minutes = total_time_hours * 60 # Total time required in minutes
